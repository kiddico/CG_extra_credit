### Drawing Characters With OpenGL

This is an attempt to draw characters using the absolute position of the trackpad.

This is to avoid the problems that come with using the regular mouse input in OpenGL. Such as acceleration, and lack of originality.

I'm not certain how I'll be implementing the actual drawing part.
I got the trackpad positioning done already thanks to the evtest source code being available.
(aka I totally just stole the bits relevant to my project)
